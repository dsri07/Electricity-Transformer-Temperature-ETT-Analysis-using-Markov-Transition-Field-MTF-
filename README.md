#STEPS
1.Import Required Libraries and Packages:
  Import necessary libraries and packages for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
2.Import the Time Series Dataset:
  Load the time series dataset containing electricity transformer temperature data.
3.Truncate and Plot the DataFrame:
  Preprocess the dataset by truncating if needed and visualize the time series data through plots.
4.Discretize the Data:
  Discretize the continuous temperature data to convert it into a format suitable for Markov analysis.
5.Create the Adjacency Matrix:
  Construct the adjacency matrix representing the relationships between discretized temperature values.
6.Calculate the Markov Matrix:
  Calculate the Markov matrix based on transition probabilities between different temperature states.
7.Create the Markov Transition Field:
  Utilize the Markov matrix to create a Markov Transition Field, which visually represents the transition probabilities over time.
8.Visualize the Markov Transition Field:
  Visualize the Markov Transition Field to observe patterns and properties in the temperature time series data.
9.Downsample the Markov Transition Field:
  Optionally downsample the Markov Transition Field for better visualization or computational efficiency.
10.Plot Self-Transition Probabilities on Time Series Data:
  Plot self-transition probabilities on the original time series data to gain insights into temporal dependencies.
11.ARIMA Model for Forecasting:
  Utilize the ARIMA model for forecasting future temperature values based on historical data.
12.Evaluate Model Performance:
  Assess the accuracy of the ARIMA model by calculating metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
