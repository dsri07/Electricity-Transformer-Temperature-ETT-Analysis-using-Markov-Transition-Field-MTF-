**STEPS:**

__1. Import Required Libraries and Packages:__

  Import necessary libraries and packages for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
  
__2.Import the Time Series Dataset:__

  Load the time series dataset containing electricity transformer temperature data.
  
__3.Truncate and Plot the DataFrame:__

  Preprocess the dataset by truncating if needed and visualize the time series data through plots.
  
__4.Discretize the Data:__

  Discretize the continuous temperature data to convert it into a format suitable for Markov analysis.
  
__5.Create the Adjacency Matrix:__

  Construct the adjacency matrix representing the relationships between discretized temperature values.
  
__6.Calculate the Markov Matrix:__

  Calculate the Markov matrix based on transition probabilities between different temperature states.
  
__7.Create the Markov Transition Field:__

  Utilize the Markov matrix to create a Markov Transition Field, which visually represents the transition probabilities over time.
  
__8.Visualize the Markov Transition Field:__

  Visualize the Markov Transition Field to observe patterns and properties in the temperature time series data.
  
__9.Downsample the Markov Transition Field:__


  Optionally downsample the Markov Transition Field for better visualization or computational efficiency.
  
__10.Plot Self-Transition Probabilities on Time Series Data:__

  Plot self-transition probabilities on the original time series data to gain insights into temporal dependencies.
  
__11.ARIMA Model for Forecasting:__

  Utilize the ARIMA model for forecasting future temperature values based on historical data.
  
__12.Evaluate Model Performance:__

  Assess the accuracy of the ARIMA model by calculating metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
